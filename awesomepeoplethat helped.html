<h1>Acknowledgements:</h1>
<p>These people/organizations all contributed to the project. Some may have done so unknowingly, such as the museum where I got the idea, and many did so through a very long and exceedingly helpful chain of emails with me. 

<p>This doesn't count any of the OSS contributors on GitHub, this is simply the people who helped "get it off the ground".
