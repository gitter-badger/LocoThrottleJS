<p>locoThrottle.js (in it's infancy) was written by me (k4kfh on GitHub) as a tool to make model railroading more realistic, more challenging, more interesting, and most importantly, more fun. I don't do this to make a profit, nor do I intend to in the future. Model railroading costs enough already, and God has blessed me with more than enough time and a 5x9 table all to myself. I don't need to make any money.

<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<h3>How do I install locoThrottle.js?</h3>
<p><b>In it's current state, only developers should try the program</b>, and for them the source code (all HTML/JavaScript) can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/k4kfh/LocoThrottleJS" target="_blank">the project's GitHub page.</a>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p><b>locoThrottle.js offers a more prototypical way to drive your model trains.</b> Instead of simply toggling a direction switch and twisting a speed knob, now you'll have to deal with a notched throttle, locomotive brakes, train brakes, wheel slip, momentum, the list goes on! Eventually, there will even be a way for the technically savvy to feed track grade info into the program, and have that play into how the trains behave. <b>In short, locoThrottle.js bridges the gap between model trains and railroad simulation.</b> We have had realistic dispatching and switching for years, and now we can finally have <i>realistic train control.</i>

<p><b>Non-geeks will be able to try the program in a browser without installing anything, here very shortly when it's in a stable state.</b> Unfortunately, right now the overall experience is not ironed out enough to begin public use. If you have questions about this, feel free to contact me via GitHub. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have, to the best of my ability.

<h3>When will it be ready?</h3>
<p><b>The short answer: I'm shooting for before August, but I can't promise anything.</b> Contact me if you would like to know more, or you can read my blog posts to learn about what's going on right now. I am in high school, so during the school year my time to work on this will likely be limited.

<h3>I'm a developer, how can I help?</h3>
<p>If you're a developer without access to model trains, you can help design user experience elements and build HTML pages. Web Developers are extremely helpful, but anyone is welcome. If you have access to model trains, particularly DCC-equipped locomotives, your help is essential. To support more than the small roster of DCC decoders I have (quite literally 2 different sound decoders) I need your help. You can help write the appropriate decoder.js file for your decoder. Hop over to the <a href="https://github.com/k4kfh/LocoThrottleJS" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> to learn more about how this works.


<h3>Can I donate to support the project?</h3>
<p>As I said above, I do not need monetary compensation for this project. I did it purely to bring joy to fellow model railroaders, and to hone my own software development skills. I also did it with the help of many others, acknowledged on my "Awesome People that Helped" page. <b>If you would like to provide monetary support for this project, please direct your donations to <a href="http://www.bloodwater.org" target="_blank">Blood:Water Mission</a>, which is dedicated to providing clean water and other necessities  to those less fortunate.</b> I think this is a much more important cause than my own financial gain.
