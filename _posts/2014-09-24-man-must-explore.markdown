<p>Yes, believe it or not, I took the time to set up a blog. I did it rather uncreatively, using GitHub pages and the popular Jekyll software, but it works.

<p>Here, I'll be posting relatively regularly, with each big milestone of the project. My first big milestone is to get the physics of the locomotive throttle working, and then the various different brakes. From there, I will work on smaller things like air compressor scripts, more decoder support, and integration with JMRI's roster.

<p>I might post a roadmap later, but for now, I'm going to leave you in mystery...
