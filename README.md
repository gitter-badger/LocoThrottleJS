# LocoThrottleJS
This project is still HEAVILY under development as of 6/4 2015. I am working on getting a mostly-realistic physics system, then I will likely release the first dev version. I eventually hope to make this so intuitive anyone can do it, but that day is not today.

## What is LocoThrottleJS
Have you ever heard of train simulators? It's like combining that and model railroading. It's a program built on top of JMRI (using entirely client-side JavaScript and HTML with WebSockets) to make driving a model train locomotive just as realistic as the real thing.
